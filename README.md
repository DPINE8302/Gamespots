# Game Center

A sleek, mobile-first hub for web games with a dark, glassy look and neon accents. Currently static with placeholder game cards.
The layout adapts to screen size, showing a bottom navigation bar on phones and a sidebar on desktops.

## Development

- `npm test` – run a simple check for the main layout
- `npm start` – serve the site locally via `http-server`

Open `index.html` directly or visit the local server to view the site. Future game pages can be linked by updating the `.game-card` anchors.
